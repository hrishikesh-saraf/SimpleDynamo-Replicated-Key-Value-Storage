# SimpleDynamo-Replicated-Key-Value-Storage
Implemented Amazon Dynamo style key-value storage system with three parts: 1) Partitioning, 2) Replication, and 3) Failure handling.
System was designed in such a way that it provided "Availability" and "Linearizability" at the same time. That is, the implementation performed read and write operations even under failures.

Tools: Android Studio
